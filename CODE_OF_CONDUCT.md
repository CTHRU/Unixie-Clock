## Respect
cthru is an intentionally positive community that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of independent creators (and independence) and the diversity of people, cultures, and opinions that they bring to the cthru community.

cthru spaces are an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, medical conditions, race and/or ethnicity, caste, nationality, religion (or lack thereof), physical appearance, politics, ideology (real world or tech), or software preferences.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

Respectful behavior includes:

- Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, gratuitous or off-topic sexual (body part), or physically threatening behavior, speech, text, names, and imagery.
- If you're not sure, ask someone instead of assuming.

cthru prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. cthru organizers reserve the right not to act on complaints regarding:

- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’.
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial.
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.

## Resolve Peacefully
We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior and feel in any way unable to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately contact us at [cthru's Portal](https://cthru.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/10). We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just icky in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.

# Apologize for Mistakes
Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, own up to your words andactions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them, and avoiding repeating them in the future.

# Consequences
If the community organizers determine that a participant is behaving disrespectfully, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the community without warning.

As community organizers, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can't foresee every situation however, and thus if in the organizers' judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave the community, we will do so.

# Resolving an Issue
If you believe you’re experiencing practices in the cthru community which doesn’t meet the policies below, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact the organizer(s) or designated code of conduct responders of the community.

If you believe you’re experiencing practices in the cthru community which don’t meet the policies above, please immediately contact any ally you may know. Anyone in the community should feel empowered to resolve issues and uphold our high standards.
